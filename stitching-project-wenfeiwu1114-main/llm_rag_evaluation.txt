As we transition from the base LLM to the advanced RAG with a fine-tuned agent, we observe notable improvements in response quality. The base LLM, while capable of generating coherent answers, often lacks grounding in retrieved documents, leading to occasional hallucinations. In contrast, the RAG-enhanced model effectively incorporates retrieved context, reducing misinformation and improving relevance. Further, the fine-tuned LoRA model enhances domain adaptation, allowing for more precise and contextually aware responses. Overall, the advanced RAG setup demonstrates superior factual consistency, improved contextual alignment, and higher response accuracy compared to the standalone base LLM.
