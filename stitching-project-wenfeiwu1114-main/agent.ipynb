The system is designed to process user queries by retrieving relevant documents, evaluating their relevance, generating responses, and iteratively refining the query when necessary. The workflow consists of interconnected nodes, each performing a specific task. The retrieval node fetches documents from a vector database, followed by a grading node that assesses their relevance. If the documents are deemed useful, the generation node produces an answer using an LLM. However, if the documents are irrelevant, the system redirects to a query transformation node to refine the question before retrying retrieval. The process continues until a high-quality response is generated. The system includes self-assessment mechanisms to verify whether the response is factual and directly answers the question. If the response is found lacking, the query is reformulated, and the process repeats. This design enables an adaptive, intelligent retrieval system that dynamically adjusts to input quality, ensuring accurate and reliable responses through iterative refinement.\"\"\"\n",

The base LLM, while capable of generating coherent answers, often lacks grounding in retrieved documents, leading to occasional hallucinations. In contrast, the RAG-enhanced model effectively incorporates retrieved context, reducing misinformation and improving relevance. Further, the fine-tuned LoRA model enhances domain adaptation, allowing for more precise and contextually aware responses. Overall, the advanced RAG setup demonstrates superior factual consistency, improved contextual alignment, and higher response accuracy compared to the standalone base LLM.\n",
